Slide 1 — Title
- Title: **Sounds of Rangi**  
- Subtitle: *Market Mayhem Orchestration*  
- Tagline: *The World’s First ADA-Compliant, Sensory-Native Financial System*  
- Visual: Cymatic pattern with 432Hz waveform overlay

Slide 2 — The Problem
- Trading data = abstract, overwhelming, inaccessible  
- Traditional charts exclude blind & neurodiverse users  
- ADA non-compliance = lost access for millions  
- Bears dominate market psychology  
- Visual: Overloaded candlestick chart + frustrated trader  

---
Slide 3 — The Solution
- Translate markets into **Sound, Sight, and Touch**  
- **432Hz Harmonic Baseline** = stable resonance  
- **111.11Hz Dual Band** = Buy/Sell acceleration  
- Cymatic visuals map volatility in real time  
- Haptic pulses make trends tactile  
- Visual: Demo mockup (market data → sound waves → cymatics → haptic feedback)  

---
Slide 4 — Why Now?
- Market tools outdated & inaccessible  
- Web3 + haptics enable new sensory-native layer  
- Global demand for ADA accessibility funding  
- Rise of sensory tech (Apple Vision, AR/VR, gaming rigs)  
- Visual: Timeline of financial tools → Sounds of Rangi at 2025

Slide 5 — How It Works
- **Backend:** Python + SciPy for harmonics  
- **Data:** CoinGecko + market APIs  
- **Sonification Engine:** 432Hz baseline + 111.11Hz dual-band  
- **Frontend:** WebGL/Three.js for cymatics  
- **Hardware:** WebHID + Bluetooth haptic integration  
- **Blockchain:** XION for authentication + Reality Capsule NFTs  
- Visual: System architecture diagram  

---
Slide 6 — XION’s Role
- Gasless transactions → frictionless NFT minting  
- Abstracted accounts → username login, no wallet hassle  
- Reality Capsules → harmonic signatures preserved forever  
- XION = accessibility-first blockchain  
- Visual: XION logo with pipeline arrows  

---
Slide 7 — Business Model
- API subscriptions: **Standard | Elite | Sovereign** tiers  
- Token ($STONE) for premium features + governance  
- Grants: ADA inclusion, Avalanche, Solana, Ethereum Foundation, XION  
- Enterprise licensing for trading platforms  
- Visual: Pricing table mockup

Slide 8 — Security & Transparency
- Title: *“From Pinky & The Brain Attacks to Fort Knox”*  
- We acknowledge flaws openly: early repos may leak keys or lack strong controls  
- Countermeasures:  
  - 🔒 **Dependency Armor:** Dependabot + CodeQL = no silent exploits  
  - 🔑 **Secret Resonance:** Keys stored/rotated with GitHub Secrets + Vault  
  - 👥 **Harmonic Controls:** Branch protection + CODEOWNERS = no rogue merges  
  - 🛡️ **Account Hardening:** WebAuthn 2FA + session audits  
- Result: A system where **resonance is the foundation of security**  
- Visual: Cartoon “Pinky & Brain” trying to hack → cymatic Fort Knox vault

Slide 9 — What’s New?
- From Charts → Harmonics  
- From Data → Sensory Experience  
- From Exclusion → ADA Inclusion  
- From Demo → Sovereign Harmonic Ledger  
- Visual: Before/After comparison

Slide 10 — Funding Ask
- Raising: **$2.2M** Seed  
- Use of Funds:  
  - Patent filings (Proof-of-Resonance, Harmonic Block)  
  - Dev team expansion  
  - Hardware integration (haptics, accessibility devices)  
  - Legal & compliance  
- Visual: Simple pie chart breakdown
