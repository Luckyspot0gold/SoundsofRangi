# Rangi's Heartbeat ‚ù§Ô∏è
### Multi-Sensory Market Sonification - XION PoC Hackathon Submission

**A visionary proof-of-concept that makes financial markets accessible through sound, touch, and sight, built on XION's gasless infrastructure.**

> **Note on Submission State:** This repository represents a passionate, intense 60-hour development sprint. The core vision is fully articulated, though some integrations remain aspirational due to the constraints of the hackathon timeline. We believe the concept demonstrates the profound potential of XION's technology for creating truly accessible Web3 experiences.

## üåü The Vision: Why This Exists

Financial trading is an overwhelmingly visual experience, excluding blind users and overloading traders with charts. Rangi's Heartbeat proposes a new paradigm: **understanding the market through harmony and vibration.**

*   **For the Visually Impaired:** This is a world's first step toward a fully ADA-compliant trading interface.
*   **For Everyone:** It offers an intuitive, gut-feel understanding of market dynamics, turning complex data into an immersive sensory experience.

## üéØ How It Works (The Concept)

Imagine the market as a symphony:
*   **BTC Price is the Singer:** Voice rises in pitch during rallies, drops in crashes.
*   **Trading Volume is the Drummer:** Soft beats in calm markets, intense rhythms during volatility.
*   **You are the Conductor:** Feel the music through your device.

This PoC aims to use **XION's gasless transactions** and **Dave Mobile Kit** to make this symphony seamless and invisible to the user.

## üß∞ Technology Stack (Aspirational & Implemented)

| Layer | Technology | Purpose | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Blockchain** | XION Testnet | Gasless transactions & wallet abstraction | *Planned Integration* |
| **Mobile Auth** | XION Dave Kit | Biometric, seedless login | *Planned Integration* |
| **Frontend** | React Native | Mobile app framework | *Planned* |
| **Audio Engine** | Web Audio API | Generating harmonic frequencies from market data | *Core Concept* |
| **Haptics** | Expo Haptics, Gamepad API | Translating market moves to vibration | *Core Concept* |
| **Data** | CoinGecko/Coinbase API | Real-time market data | *Planned* |

## üî¨ The Core Innovation: 7-Bell H.R.I. (Harmonic Resonance Index)

Our proprietary model maps market data to harmonic frequencies based on natural mathematical constants:

*   **Base Frequency:** 432 Hz (The "Heartbeat")
*   **Llama Frequency:** 111.11 Hz (The "Return-to-Sender" panic signal on >5% drops)
*   **Additional Bells:** 86Hz, 753Hz, 1074Hz, 1395Hz, 1618Hz (Fibonacci-derived)

This system creates a unique audio signature for different market conditions, from stable growth to extreme volatility.

## üöÄ Running the Project (Current State)

This repository currently contains the foundational concepts, architectural plans, and initial code structures for Rangi's Heartbeat. Full integration with the XION Dave Mobile Kit is the key next step for a functional demo.

We welcome developers to fork this repo and collaborate on bringing this vision to life.
